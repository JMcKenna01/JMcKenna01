ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Joe McKenna, a passionate full-stack developer based in Long Island, NY. I graduated from the University of Central Florida's Full-Stack Web Development Boot Camp, where I honed my skills in the MERN stack.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on NexGenFinance, a personal finance management tool designed to help users track their income, expenses, and investments. This project reflects my commitment to building user-centric applications that simplify complex processes.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m always learning and currently diving deeper into progressive web applications and advanced React techniques.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source projects and innovative tech solutions that aim to make a significant impact.

âš¡ Fun fact: When I'm not coding, I'm probably hiking or experimenting with IoT projects.
